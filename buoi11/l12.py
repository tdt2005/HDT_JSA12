Part A
A palindrome is a word that is spelt the same forward and backwards. Your task is to write a function that
takes, as input, a single word and returns True if it is a palindrome and False otherwise.

Part B
Using your function from Part A, write a program which reads words from a file. For each word, print
"<word> is a palindrome" if the word is a palindrome, or "<word> is not a palindrome" if not. You
can test you program on the file palindromic.txt
Example: 
'''
def palindrone(st):
    pass


with open(r"palindromic.txt") as f:
    pass
